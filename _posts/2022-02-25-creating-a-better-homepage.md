## Introduction

### Explanation

My current homepage isn't great. It's a lot of text and a weirdly-placed link. It has odd spacing issues. It's just...boring. And not good. Kind of bad.

I want to fix this.

Specifically, I want a pretty homepage that explains, in brief, what this site is about, and then contains links to my pages. Currently, I only have one sort of page: posts. I may expand that in this story.

### Create "about me" page

I want users to know who I am, but I don't want it front and center. To do this, I will change my current `index.js` to become an `about.js`. I will then create a new, empty, `index.js` to serve as the root of my site.
