# Personal Site

This is my personal site to play, learn, and maybe advertise myself.

This project has grown to include learning about integrating with SaaS services (MongodDB Atlas, CircleCI, Codecov, Vercel), testing (Jest, Cypress, CircleCI again), CSS, and of course React on NextJS. Right now, I'm just following wherever it leads, with no specific end goal in sight. I'm having a lot of fun and learning quite a bit as I go.
